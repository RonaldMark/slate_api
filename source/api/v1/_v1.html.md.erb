Welcome to SwitchLink APIs!

The API is organized around REST.

Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, 
and uses standard HTTP response codes and authentication.

Authorization is through basic auth(username:password) to validate the requests.

Content-Type:application/json

A hash is also computed using some mandatory request parameters and a key that is preshared on the registration process.
